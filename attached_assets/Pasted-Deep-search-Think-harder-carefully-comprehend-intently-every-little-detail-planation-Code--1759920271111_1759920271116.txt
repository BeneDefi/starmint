POST https://starmint.onrender.com/api/game/session 500 (Internal Server Error)
Use code snippets with caution

Understanding the problem
This console message indicates that a POST request sent from your frontend code to the URL https://starmint.onrender.com/api/game/session resulted in a 500 Internal Server Error status code. A 500 error is a generic server-side error, meaning the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. It signals a problem on the server's end, not with the request itself from the client's perspective.

Based on the provided search results, possible causes for a 500 error include:

Improper server configuration [1].
Out-of-memory issues on the server [1].
Unhandled exceptions in the server code [1, 3].
Improper file permissions on the server [1].
Failures from backend servers that your server depends on [3].
The fetch call in your code successfully sent the request, but the server responded with an error status. The traceback in the console shows that the error occurred during the endGame function, which is where your fetch call is located.

How to verify
To verify that the issue is server-side, you can check the server logs for the starmint.onrender.com application. Look for error messages that coincide with the timestamp of the failed POST request to /api/game/session. The logs should provide more specific details about what went wrong on the server.

You can also try sending the same POST request to the endpoint using a tool like cURL or Postman to see if the error is reproducible outside of your frontend application [4]. If the request still results in a 500 error, it further confirms a server issue.

Suggested fix
The fix for a 500 Internal Server Error lies on the server side. You need to:

Access the server logs for your application hosted on Render.
Analyze the logs to identify the specific error or unhandled exception that occurred when processing the POST request to /api/game/session.
Debug the server-side code handling the /api/game/session endpoint based on the error details from the logs. This might involve fixing code bugs, addressing database issues, or resolving configuration problems.
Since the specific cause is unknown without the server logs, there is no direct code change to suggest for your frontend JavaScript. The problem is on the server.

Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error for a POST request indicates a problem on the server side. To fix this, you need to examine the server logs for your application hosted on Render to understand the specific error that occurred and then debug the server-side code handling the affected endpoint.

Explanation

Understanding the problem
This console error message indicates that the application attempted to save the game session data to the server but the save operation failed due to a reason that is not related to authentication. Because the error is not authentication related, the application logic has determined that retrying the save operation is unlikely to succeed, hence "no retry needed for non-auth errors".

The stack trace shows that the error originated within the endGame function and was likely triggered after an asynchronous operation (await in endGame). The subsequent lines in the stack trace (j @ index-CoSDzj1o.js:40, requestAnimationFrame) suggest that this error might be happening within a loop or animation frame, potentially indicating that the game save is being attempted repeatedly after the initial failure.

Suggested fix
The code snippet you provided only shows the error logging and event dispatching. To fix the issue, you need to address the underlying reason for the save failure. This error message doesn't provide specific details about why the save failed. You'll need to investigate the server-side code or network requests involved in saving the game session to pinpoint the exact cause.

Here are some potential areas to investigate:

Network issues: The client might be offline or experiencing connectivity problems.
Server-side errors: The server might be down, overloaded, or experiencing an internal error when processing the save request.
Invalid data: The data being sent to the server for saving might be malformed or missing required information.
Database issues: The server might be unable to write the data to the database.
Rate limiting: The server might be rate-limiting requests, and the game is attempting to save too frequently.
To start debugging, you should:

Inspect network requests: Use the Network tab in Chrome DevTools to examine the request made to save the game session. Look for failed requests (indicated by red status codes like 4xx or 5xx) and examine the response from the server for error details.
Check server logs: If you have access to the server logs, examine them for any errors or warnings that coincide with the failed save attempt.
Add more specific logging: Modify your endGame function to log more details about the save attempt, such as the data being sent to the server and the specific error response received (if any).
Without more context on the server-side implementation and the exact nature of the save operation, it's impossible to provide a specific code fix. The fix will depend on identifying the root cause of the non-authentication related failure.

Summary
The "Game session save failed - no retry needed for non-auth errors" message indicates a failure to save game data to the server due to a reason other than authentication. To resolve this, investigate network requests, server logs, and add more detailed logging to pinpoint the specific cause of the failure.

 GET https://starmint.onrender.com/api/player-stats/12345 500 (Internal Server Error)
Explanation

Understanding the problem
The console error GET https://starmint.onrender.com/api/player-stats/12345 500 (Internal Server Error) indicates that your application made a GET request to the URL https://starmint.onrender.com/api/player-stats/12345, and the server responded with a 500 Internal Server Error status code. This is a generic server-side error indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request [1, 4, 5]. The issue is not with the client-side code making the request, but rather with the server's ability to process that request successfully [3].

How to verify
You can verify this by checking the network tab in Chrome DevTools. Find the request to https://starmint.onrender.com/api/player-stats/12345 and examine its response. You will see the status code is 500. The response body might contain more specific details about the error on the server side, if the server is configured to provide them.

Suggested fix
Since the error is on the server side, you need to investigate the server logs for your application hosted at starmint.onrender.com. Look for error messages or stack traces that correspond to the time the request was made. The logs should provide more specific information about what went wrong, such as a database error, a bug in the server-side code handling the /api/player-stats/:id endpoint, or an issue with an external service the server depends on [3, 2].

Common causes for 500 errors include:

Errors in the server-side code logic.
Issues with database connections or queries.
Problems with third-party APIs or services the server is calling.
Incorrect server configuration.
Once you identify the root cause from the server logs, you can fix the issue in your server-side code or configuration.

Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error on an API request means the problem is on the server side, not in your client-side JavaScript. To fix it, you must examine the server logs to understand the specific error occurring when the /api/player-stats/:id endpoint is accessed and address the issue on the server.

Use code snippets with caution

Understanding the problem
The console message "API request failed: 500 Internal server error" indicates that your client-side JavaScript code made an API request that resulted in an HTTP 500 status code response from the server. The 500 Internal Server Error is a generic server-side error indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request [1, 2]. The additional {"error":"Internal server error"} part of the message is likely the response body from the server, providing a bit more detail about the error, although it's still quite general.

The traceback provided shows that the error occurred within a function called loadPlayerStats, likely during an awaited API call.

Suggested fix
Since the 500 error is a server-side issue, the fix needs to be implemented on the server that the API request was made to. You will need to investigate the server-side logs and code to understand the specific cause of the unexpected condition. Common causes for 500 errors include:

Errors in the server-side code (e.g., unhandled exceptions, logic errors).
Issues with database connections or queries.
Problems with external services the server relies on.
Incorrect server configuration.
To fix this, you should:

Access Server Logs: Check the logs of your backend server application. These logs often contain more detailed error messages or stack traces that can pinpoint the exact line of code or condition causing the 500 error.
Inspect Server-Side Code: Review the server-side code that handles the API endpoint being called by your loadPlayerStats function. Look for potential errors, unhandled exceptions, or issues with external dependencies.
Debug the Server: Use debugging tools on your server to step through the code execution when the API request is made.
There is no change required to your client-side JavaScript code shown, as it is correctly reporting the server error.

Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error means the problem lies with the server, not your client-side JavaScript. You need to investigate the server's logs and code to identify and fix the root cause of the error.

Understanding the problem
The console message "GET https://starmint.onrender.com/api/purchase-history/12345?limit=50 500 (Internal Server Error)" indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request [1, 2]. Your front-end code is attempting to fetch data from the URL https://starmint.onrender.com/api/purchase-history/12345?limit=50 using the fetch API, but the server is returning a 500 Internal Server Error status code [1, 3]. This is a generic server-side error and doesn't specifically point to an issue with your client-side code, but rather with the backend processing of this particular request [2].

Suggested fix
Since the error originates on the server side, you will need to investigate the backend code that handles the /api/purchase-history/:userId endpoint. Look for potential issues such as database errors, unhandled exceptions, improper server configuration, or out-of-memory issues [1, 2].

Here are some common areas to check on the server:

Error logs: Examine the server logs for detailed error messages that can pinpoint the exact cause of the failure.
Database connectivity and queries: Ensure the server can connect to the database and that the queries used to fetch purchase history are correct and not causing errors.
Backend code logic: Step through the code that handles the /api/purchase-history/:userId endpoint to identify any logical errors or unhandled exceptions.
Resource limits: Check if the server is hitting any resource limits (e.g., memory, CPU) that might be causing it to fail.
Environment variables and configuration: Verify that all necessary environment variables and server configurations are correctly set.
The provided front-end code using fetch is correctly handling the response status by checking r.ok and logging an error if the response is not OK [3]. The issue lies in what the server is returning.

Summary
A 500 Internal Server Error means the server failed to process a request due to an unexpected condition on the server side [1, 2]. To fix this, you need to debug the backend code handling the affected API endpoint (/api/purchase-history/:userId) to find and resolve the server-side issue.
